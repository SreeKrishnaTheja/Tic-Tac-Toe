# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple game which we've been playing since the childhood , made for mobile using react native


I have started with using the expo-cli for building the boiler plate code for react-native

The mail library that I used to get the click event is TouchableWithoutFeedback for tracking the block that is being selected by the player

Steps to run the project :

clone the code repository 
Install expo cli by using the following command : npm i expo-cli
Install expo go application in your mobile
run the project by using the following command : npx expo start --tunnel
scan the QR code that is being shown in the cli using the expo go application installed in your mobile
the app will start building in your mobile


I also built an apk if at all you can try to install and check it out (please find the apk in the below mentioned google drive link)
